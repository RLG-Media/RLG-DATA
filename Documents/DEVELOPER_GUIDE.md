## 1. Introduction

**RLG Data** and **RLG Fans** are integrated, AI-powered solutions designed to provide brands, creators, and influencers with advanced tools for:
- **Data intelligence & analytics**
- **Social media scraping and compliance monitoring**
- **Real-time trend prediction and competitor analysis**
- **Dynamic, region-based pricing** (with a hard geo-location pricing lock on Israel)
- **Automated brand monitoring and subscription management**

This guide will walk you through the technical aspects required to build, test, deploy, and maintain these tools.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### System Components
- **Frontend:** Web-based interfaces built using modern JavaScript frameworks (React/Vue) for dashboards, pricing pages, user settings, etc.
- **Backend:** Python-based services (Flask/FastAPI) that handle application logic, API endpoints, data processing, and integration with third-party services.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data; Redis for caching and rate limiting.
- **File Storage:** Git LFS for large file management (split files are tracked and uploaded separately).
- **Monitoring & Automation:** Services for system health (using psutil, Kubernetes API) and scheduled tasks (using Celery).
- **External Integrations:** APIs for social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook), monetization platforms (OnlyFans, Patreon, Fansly), and payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, PayFast).

### Service Integrations
- **Social Media & Data Scraping:** Integrates with Twitter, Instagram, Facebook for real-time social data.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Utilizes Google Analytics, custom AI modules (trend_predictor.py, recommendation_engine.py) for insights.
- **Compliance & Security:** Implements scraping and compliance tools ensuring GDPR, CCPA compliance, and rate limiting.
- **Payment Processing:** Supports multiple gateways (Stripe, PayPal, PayFast) with region-specific pricing, including a hard pricing lock for users in Israel.

PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret
PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID=your_payfast_merchant_id
PAYFAST_MERCHANT_KEY=your_payfast_merchant_key
Initialize Database:
bash
Copy
Edit
flask db upgrade  # For Flask-SQLAlchemy migrations
4. Backend Components
Key Services and Modules
API Endpoints (api_endpoints.py):
Exposes RESTful endpoints (e.g., /api/analytics, /api/fans) for data access.
Data Processing (data_processing.py):
Handles data collection, cleaning, and transformation.
AI and Analytics Modules:
trend_predictor.py: Predicts trends based on historical data.
recommendation_engine.py: Generates personalized recommendations.
Monitoring Service (monitoring_service.py):
Continuously monitors system health, external API statuses, and logs errors.
Scheduled Tasks:
Implemented using Celery for periodic data updates and report generation.
Database and Models
PostgreSQL: Main storage for users, reports, analytics, and subscription data.
Redis: Used for caching, session management, and rate limiting.
5. Frontend Components
Dashboard:
Provides real-time insights, analytics, and monitoring.
Pricing & Subscription Pages:
Interactive pages with dynamic, region-based pricing.
Note: Special pricing for Israel is locked in upon registration.
User Profile & Settings:
Allows users to update account details, manage notifications, and customize their experience.
Responsive Design:
Utilizes modern CSS frameworks and responsive design principles.
6. Integrations and External APIs
Social Media APIs:
Integrates with Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.
Payment Gateways:
Processes payments using Stripe, PayPal, and PayFast.
Compliance Tools:
Built-in scraping and compliance tools to ensure data privacy and regulatory adherence.
Third-Party Integrations (third_party_integrations.py):
Connects with external services for real-time data, analytics, and automated actions.
7. Testing and Debugging
Backend Testing:
Uses pytest for API and unit tests.
Frontend Testing:
Uses Jest/Mocha for component testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
Integration Tests:
Ensures data processing, scraping, and API integrations function as expected.
Logging:
Comprehensive logging is implemented using Python's logging module and integrated with Sentry for error tracking.
8. Deployment and Maintenance
Docker & Docker Compose:
Containerize the application for consistency across environments.
Kubernetes:
Use kubernetes_config.yaml for orchestrating deployments, scaling, and monitoring.
CI/CD Pipeline:
Set up using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing, building, and deployment.
Monitoring:
Utilize tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance metrics, and Sentry for error tracking.
Git LFS:
Handles large file storage for assets exceeding standard Git limits.
9. Security and Best Practices
Secure Environment Variables:
Use .env files or a secrets manager for sensitive information.
Authentication & Authorization:
Implement JWT for secure user sessions and role-based access.
Input Validation & Rate Limiting:
Sanitize all inputs and enforce rate limits to prevent abuse.
Data Encryption:
Use AES-256 and RSA hybrid encryption (see data_encryption.py) for sensitive data.
Compliance:
Ensure GDPR, CCPA, and other legal standards are met with automated compliance tools.
Code Quality:
Follow PEP 8 (Python) and ESLint (JavaScript) standards.
10. Special Features and Enhancements
Hard Geo-Location Pricing Lock on Israel:
During user registration, the system detects the userâ€™s location using geolocation_service.py.
If the user is from Israel, their pricing is locked to the special region pricing (e.g., $99/month for Premium, $35/week for Creator) and rate limits are adjusted accordingly.
The pricing page is only accessible after registration so that the system can securely lock in the location.
AI-Powered Data Scraping and Trend Prediction:
Uses advanced AI to gather real-time data from various sources.
Provides dynamic, personalized recommendations and competitor analysis.
Automated Monitoring and Error Tracking:
The monitoring_service.py continuously checks system health and notifies admins via email and Slack.
Comprehensive Subscription Management:
Enables users to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions with region-based pricing enforcement.
11. Additional Recommendations
Documentation:
Keep this guide and your API documentation updated.

Version Control:
Use feature branches and merge requests for ongoing development.

User Feedback:
Implement a feedback mechanism within the tool to gather user input and continuously improve functionality.

Performance Optimization:
Regularly review logs and performance metrics to optimize resource usage and speed.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
Automate your testing and deployment processes to ensure rapid, reliable updates.
