# Disaster Recovery Plan for RLG Data & RLG Fans

## Overview

This Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) outlines the steps necessary to restore critical systems and data in the event of a failure. It includes strategies for recovering **RLG Data** and **RLG Fans**, ensuring minimal downtime, safeguarding data integrity, and maintaining business continuity. The plan covers both the **backend infrastructure** and **front-end services** for seamless recovery.

### Objectives

- Minimize downtime for both RLG Data and RLG Fans platforms.
- Ensure full recovery of all critical data.
- Ensure the integrity and security of restored data.
- Enable efficient communication with stakeholders during and after recovery.

## 1. **Risk Assessment**

Before implementing the recovery plan, it is essential to assess the following risks that could impact the platform:

- **Hardware Failures**: Server crashes, storage failures, network issues.
- **Software Failures**: Corrupt databases, application crashes, failed deployments.
- **Data Loss**: Data corruption, deletion, or failure to back up critical data.
- **Cybersecurity Attacks**: Data breaches, ransomware attacks, DDoS attacks.
- **Natural Disasters**: Power outages, fires, floods, earthquakes, etc.

## 2. **Critical Systems and Data**

The following systems and data are essential to the operation of **RLG Data** and **RLG Fans**:

- **Database Servers**: Primary data stores for user and transactional data.
  - MySQL/PostgreSQL Database Instances.
  - Backups of database schemas, user profiles, content, and logs.
  
- **Backend Services**:
  - REST API endpoints.
  - Microservices (authentication, notifications, analytics, etc.).
  
- **Frontend Services**:
  - User interfaces for RLG Data and RLG Fans.
  - Admin dashboards and reporting tools.
  
- **File Storage**:
  - Cloud storage for user-generated content, media, and reports.
  - Backup of user data and media files.

- **Backup Systems**:
  - Daily database backups.
  - Backup of critical configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.py`, etc.).
  - Backup of application logs.

## 3. **Recovery Objectives**

### 3.1 **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**

- **RLG Data** and **RLG Fans** should be back online within **2 hours** of a disaster event. This includes restoring the database, services, and any impacted infrastructure.
  
### 3.2 **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**

- Data should be restored to the state it was in **1 hour** before the disaster event. Backups should be performed regularly to ensure the most recent state is preserved.

## 4. **Disaster Recovery Procedures**

### 4.1 **Step 1: Detection & Notification**

- **Monitor System Health**: Use tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **New Relic** for continuous monitoring. Any anomaly or system failure should trigger an alert.
- **Notify Stakeholders**: Automated notifications (via email or SMS) should be sent to the IT team, project managers, and key stakeholders upon detection of an issue.

### 4.2 **Step 2: Initial Assessment**

- **Assess the Situation**: Determine the scope and severity of the disaster (e.g., server failure, data corruption, DDoS attack).
- **Contain the Issue**: If the problem is related to a specific component (e.g., database or application server), isolate the affected system to prevent further damage.

### 4.3 **Step 3: Recovery Actions**

#### **Database Recovery**

1. **Restore from Backup**:
   - Retrieve the most recent backup (either from daily or hourly snapshots).
   - If using cloud-based backups, ensure that backup files are up-to-date.
   - For **MySQL/PostgreSQL** backups, use `mysqldump` (for MySQL) or `pg_restore` (for PostgreSQL) to restore the database.
   
   Example command for MySQL:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p database_name < /path/to/backup.sql
Example command for PostgreSQL:

bash
Copy code
pg_restore -U user -d database_name /path/to/backup.sql
Validate Data Integrity:

After restoring the database, verify the integrity of the restored data, ensuring no corruption or data loss has occurred.
Use automated test scripts to confirm that critical data (e.g., user profiles, transactions) is intact.
Restore File Storage:

Restore user-generated content from cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.).
Validate that the media files are available and accessible via the platform.
Application Recovery
Restore Backend Services:

Restart any affected microservices (e.g., authentication, analytics, notifications) using Docker or Kubernetes.
Ensure that all necessary configurations (e.g., environment variables) are in place.
Example for Docker:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Check API Endpoints:

Verify that all critical API endpoints are functional by using automated API tests (e.g., Postman, pytest).
If necessary, roll back to a previous stable version using version control (e.g., Git).
Restore Frontend Services:

If the front-end is down, restore the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) and ensure that the frontend assets (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are served correctly.
Ensure the web application is up to date and running on the latest stable version.
Network and Infrastructure Recovery
Restore Servers:

If server hardware fails, initiate cloud server replacement (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Cloud VM) or restore the virtual machines.
Ensure that all dependencies (e.g., storage, load balancers) are reattached to the new servers.
Check Load Balancers and Traffic Routing:

Ensure that traffic is routed to the healthy instances using load balancers.
If using Kubernetes, ensure that pod replicas are scaled appropriately for load balancing.
4.4 Step 4: Validation & Testing
Functional Testing:

Run a series of tests (e.g., database queries, API tests, UI tests) to ensure that the platform is functional and responsive.
Confirm that backups have been restored correctly and that all user-generated content is available.
Stress Testing:

Conduct load testing to ensure that the application can handle traffic spikes post-recovery.
User Verification:

Involve a small group of end-users to verify that critical functionalities (e.g., login, payments, content viewing) work as expected.
4.5 Step 5: Post-Recovery Actions
Monitoring:

Implement enhanced monitoring to detect any abnormal behavior during the recovery period.
Track the recovery process to ensure systems are stable and fully restored.
Root Cause Analysis:

Conduct a post-mortem analysis to identify the root cause of the disaster.
Document the lessons learned and implement improvements to prevent future occurrences.
Update the DRP:

Review and update the disaster recovery plan based on the recovery experience and any issues encountered.
Ensure that all personnel are trained on the updated procedures.
5. Backup and Redundancy Strategies
To ensure data protection and system reliability, the following backup and redundancy strategies should be implemented:

Automated Backups:

Perform daily database backups with hourly incremental backups.
Use cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for secure and redundant backup storage.
Replication:

Implement database replication for critical data, ensuring that there are multiple copies of the database in different locations.
Geo-Redundancy:

Use multi-region cloud services for disaster recovery, ensuring that services are available even in the event of a regional outage.
Hot Standby:

Implement hot standby servers for critical backend services, ensuring that failover happens seamlessly without significant downtime.
