# Backup Strategy for RLG Data & RLG Fans

This document outlines the backup strategy for RLG Data and RLG Fans. It is designed to ensure data integrity, availability, and compliance while supporting a robust, scalable, and automated solution that accurately handles region-specific, country-specific, city-specific, and town-specific data. The strategy encompasses our full suite of services—including data scraping, compliance monitoring, AI-driven analysis, reporting, monetization strategies, newsletter distribution, RLG Agent Chat Bot, and integration with the RLG Super Tool—while maintaining regional pricing integrity. (Israel's pricing is hard locked and described as a “Special Region”, and SADC pricing tiers are applied accordingly.)

## 1. Objectives

- **Data Integrity:**  
  Ensure that all critical data is backed up and remains uncorrupted.
- **Data Availability:**  
  Enable quick and reliable restoration of data in case of system failure, accidental deletion, or disaster.
- **Compliance:**  
  Meet regulatory and business requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding data retention and protection.
- **Scalability & Automation:**  
  Support automated backup schedules and scalable storage solutions to handle growing data volumes.
- **Regional Accuracy:**  
  Ensure that backups capture region-, country-, city-, and town-specific data accurately, preserving pricing rules (e.g., Special Region pricing for Israel and SADC tiers).

## 2. Backup Types

### 2.1 Full Backups
- **Definition:**  
  A complete copy of the entire dataset.
- **Frequency:**  
  Weekly (e.g., every Sunday at 2 AM).
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides a comprehensive snapshot for full restoration.

### 2.2 Incremental Backups
- **Definition:**  
  Backs up only the data that has changed since the last backup (full or incremental).
- **Frequency:**  
  Daily (e.g., every night at 2 AM).
- **Purpose:**  
  Reduces backup time and storage requirements while maintaining recovery points.

### 2.3 Differential Backups (Optional)
- **Definition:**  
  Backs up all changes made since the last full backup.
- **Frequency:**  
  Can be used as an alternative or complement to incremental backups.
- **Purpose:**  
  Simplifies the restoration process compared to incremental backups.

## 3. Backup Storage Options

### 3.1 Local Storage
- **Location:**  
  Designated backup directory on a secure file server.
- **Technology:**  
  Use the local file system with rotating, encrypted ZIP archives.
- **Advantages:**  
  Fast access for restoration in a controlled environment.
- **Considerations:**  
  Ensure redundancy (e.g., RAID configuration) to avoid single points of failure.

### 3.2 Cloud Storage Integration
- **Providers:**  
  AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or other secure cloud providers.
- **Approach:**  
  - Upload full and incremental backups to the cloud using provider SDKs or APIs.
  - Encrypt backups before upload using strong encryption (e.g., AES, Fernet).
- **Advantages:**  
  Off-site storage for disaster recovery, high scalability, and durability.
- **Considerations:**  
  Ensure secure transmission (HTTPS) and proper access controls.

## 4. Restoration Process

### 4.1 Restoration Procedure
1. **Identify the Backup:**  
   Determine whether a full, incremental, or differential backup set is needed.
2. **Download (if cloud-based):**  
   Retrieve the necessary backup files from cloud storage.
3. **Decryption & Extraction:**  
   Decrypt backup files and extract contents.
4. **Validation:**  
   Verify data integrity using checksums or hash comparisons.
5. **Restoration:**  
   Replace or merge the restored data with the current system.
6. **Testing:**  
   Validate that the restored system functions correctly.

### 4.2 Rollback Plan
- Maintain a rollback strategy to revert to the previous stable backup if restoration issues arise.

---

## 5. Security Measures

- **Encryption:**  
  - Encrypt backup files using robust standards (e.g., AES or Fernet).
  - Securely store encryption keys using a dedicated secrets management system.
- **Access Control:**  
  - Restrict access to backup files and storage locations.
  - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for backup management.
- **Data Anonymization:**  
  - Anonymize sensitive data before backup where required for compliance with privacy regulations.

---

## 6. Monitoring & Testing

### 6.1 Monitoring
- **Logging:**  
  - Log all backup and restoration operations.
  - Integrate logs with centralized logging systems for real-time monitoring.
- **Alerts:**  
  - Configure alerts for backup failures or data inconsistencies.
  - Use external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana) to track backup health.

### 6.2 Testing
- **Regular Testing:**  
  - Schedule monthly restoration drills to verify backup integrity.
- **Automation:**  
  - Use scripts to automatically validate backup decryption and extraction.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Maintain and update documentation detailing the backup and restoration processes, including any encountered issues and resolutions.

---

## 7. Backup Retention Policy

- **Retention Duration:**  
  - Full Backups: Retained for 3 months.
  - Incremental/Differential Backups: Retained for 1 month.
- **Archiving:**  
  - Archive older backups to long-term storage or securely delete them in compliance with your retention policy.
- **Compliance:**  
  - Ensure the backup retention strategy aligns with applicable data protection regulations.

---

## 8. Tools & Technologies

- **Python Libraries:**  
  - `shutil`, `os`, `cryptography` (for encryption), `logging`, `datetime`
- **Cloud SDKs:**  
  - AWS SDK (`boto3`), Google Cloud Storage client, or Azure SDK as required.
- **Automation & Scheduling:**  
  - Celery for scheduling automated backups.
  - Cron jobs or Docker-based schedulers for periodic tasks.

---

## 9. Additional Recommendations

- **Environment Configuration:**  
  - Utilize environment variables (e.g., with `python-dotenv`) to manage sensitive information.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Design backup systems for horizontal scaling as data volumes increase.
- **Compliance & Auditing:**  
  - Regularly audit backup logs and validate processes for compliance with regional data protection laws.
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  - Incorporate backup strategies into the broader disaster recovery plan (including off-site storage and failover procedures).
- **Documentation & Training:**  
  - Provide thorough documentation and training to IT staff on backup and restoration procedures.
- **Regular Review:**  
  - Periodically review and update backup configurations to adapt to new business requirements and technology changes.
