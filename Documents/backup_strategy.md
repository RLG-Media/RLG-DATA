# Backup Strategy for RLG Data & RLG Fans

This document outlines the backup strategy for RLG Data and RLG Fans. It is designed to ensure data integrity, availability, and compliance while supporting a robust, scalable, and automated solution that can handle regional, country, city, and town-specific data requirements.

---

## 1. Objectives

- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that all critical data is backed up and remains uncorrupted.
- **Data Availability:** Enable quick and reliable restoration of data in case of system failure, accidental deletion, or disaster.
- **Compliance:** Meet regulatory and business requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding data retention and protection.
- **Scalability & Automation:** Support automated backup schedules and scalable storage solutions to accommodate growing data volumes.
- **Regional Accuracy:** Ensure that backups capture region-specific, country-specific, city-specific, and town-specific data accurately.

## 2. Backup Types

### 2.1 Full Backups
- **Definition:** A complete copy of the entire dataset.
- **Frequency:** Weekly (e.g., every Sunday at 2 AM).
- **Purpose:** Provides a complete snapshot for full restoration.

### 2.2 Incremental Backups
- **Definition:** Backs up only the data that has changed since the last backup (full or incremental).
- **Frequency:** Daily (e.g., every night at 2 AM).
- **Purpose:** Reduces backup time and storage requirements while maintaining data recovery points.

### 2.3 Differential Backups (Optional)
- **Definition:** Backs up the changes made since the last full backup.
- **Frequency:** Can be used as an alternative or complement to incremental backups.
- **Purpose:** Simplifies the restoration process compared to incremental backups.

## 3. Backup Storage Options

### 3.1 Local Storage
- **Location:** Designated backup directory on a secure file server.
- **Technology:** Use local file system with rotating encrypted ZIP archives.
- **Advantages:** Fast access for restoration, controlled environment.
- **Considerations:** Ensure redundancy (e.g., RAID configuration) to prevent single points of failure.

### 3.2 Cloud Storage Integration
- **Providers:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage (or any provider that meets your needs).
- **Approach:** 
  - Upload full and incremental backups to the cloud using provider SDKs or APIs.
  - Encrypt backups before upload using strong encryption (e.g., Fernet symmetric encryption).
- **Advantages:** Off-site storage for disaster recovery, scalability, and durability.
- **Considerations:** Ensure secure transmission (HTTPS) and proper access controls.

## 4. Restoration Process

### 4.1 Restoration Procedure
1. **Identify the Backup:** Determine whether a full backup or incremental/differential backups are required.
2. **Download (if cloud-based):** Retrieve the necessary backup files from cloud storage.
3. **Decryption & Extraction:** Decrypt the backup files and extract the contents.
4. **Validation:** Verify data integrity (e.g., using checksums or hash comparisons).
5. **Restoration:** Replace or merge the restored data with the current system.
6. **Testing:** Validate that the restored system functions correctly.

### 4.2 Rollback Plan
- Maintain a rollback plan to revert to previous stable backups if data restoration leads to issues.

---

## 5. Security Measures

- **Encryption:**  
  - Encrypt backup files using a robust encryption standard (e.g., Fernet, AES).
  - Securely store encryption keys (preferably in a secrets management system).
- **Access Control:**  
  - Restrict access to backup files and storage systems.
  - Use role-based access controls (RBAC) for backup management.
- **Data Anonymization:**  
  - Where required, anonymize sensitive data before backup to comply with privacy regulations.

---

## 6. Monitoring & Testing

### 6.1 Monitoring
- **Logging:**  
  - Log all backup and restoration operations.
  - Integrate with centralized logging (e.g., using `logging_config.py`) for monitoring.
- **Alerts:**  
  - Configure alerts for backup failures or anomalies.
  - Use external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track backup health.

### 6.2 Testing
- **Regular Testing:**  
  - Schedule regular (e.g., monthly) restoration drills to verify backup integrity.
- **Automation:**  
  - Automate backup validation using scripts that attempt decryption and extraction.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Maintain detailed documentation of the backup and restoration process, including any issues and resolutions.

---

## 7. Backup Retention Policy

- **Retention Duration:**  
  - Full Backups: Retain for 3 months.
  - Incremental/Differential Backups: Retain for 1 month.
- **Archiving:**  
  - Older backups should be archived to long-term storage or deleted securely based on retention policies.
- **Compliance:**  
  - Ensure backup retention policies comply with regulatory requirements.

---

## 8. Tools & Technologies

- **Python Libraries:**  
  - `shutil`, `os`, `cryptography` (for encryption), `logging`, `datetime`
- **Cloud SDKs:**  
  - AWS SDK (`boto3`), Google Cloud Storage client, or Azure SDK as applicable.
- **Automation & Scheduling:**  
  - Celery for scheduling backups.
  - Cron jobs or Docker-based scheduling for periodic tasks.

---

## 9. Additional Recommendations

- **Environment Configuration:**  
  - Use environment variables (with tools like `python-dotenv`) to manage sensitive configuration settings.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Consider horizontal scaling of backup systems as data volume grows.
- **Compliance & Auditing:**  
  - Regularly review and audit backup logs to ensure compliance with regional data protection laws.
- **Documentation & Training:**  
  - Ensure that IT staff are trained on the backup and restoration procedures.
- **Disaster Recovery Planning:**  
  - Integrate backup strategies into a broader disaster recovery plan, including off-site storage and failover procedures.

## Conclusion

This backup strategy document provides a robust and scalable approach to protect and restore data for RLG Data and RLG Fans. It outlines the processes and technologies required to ensure that backups are reliable, secure, and compliant with regional requirements. Regular testing and monitoring are essential to maintain the integrity of the backup system and ensure business continuity.

For further details on implementation, refer to the associated Python modules (e.g., `data_backup.py`) and the overall system documentation.
