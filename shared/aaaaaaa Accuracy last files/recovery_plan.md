---

## 3. Scope
This recovery plan applies to all critical components of RLG Data and RLG Fans, including:
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL, Redis.
- **Application Servers**: Backend services.
- **Frontend Services**: Web applications.
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs and integrations.
- **Third-party Integrations**: APIs from external services and partners.
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud environments, virtual machines, containers, etc.

---

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
- **IT Operations Team**: Responsible for executing recovery procedures and ensuring system uptime.
- **Development Team**: Collaborate on application-level recovery strategies and post-mortem analysis.
- **Security Team**: Handle breaches, perform forensics, and secure the environment.
- **Business Continuity Team**: Ensure operations continue during recovery phases.

---

## 5. Recovery Strategies

### 5.1. **Data Backup & Retention**
- **Backup Frequency**: Daily backups of databases and critical application data.
- **Offsite Backups**: Store backups in geographically distributed locations using cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
- **Backup Integrity Testing**: Periodically verify backups to ensure data consistency and recoverability.
- **Backup Retention Period**: Maintain backups for a minimum of 30 days.

### 5.2. **System Redundancy**
- **High Availability (HA)**: Utilize redundant systems for critical services to ensure continuous availability.
- **Database Cluster**: Deploy PostgreSQL in a master-slave configuration to provide automatic failover.
- **Cloud Load Balancers**: Ensure traffic distribution across multiple instances for high availability.
- **Load Balancer**: Ensure failover between primary and backup servers.

### 5.3. **Data Recovery Steps**
- **Data Recovery Sites**: Utilize secondary data centers to restore services.
- **Manual & Automated Recovery**: Implement automated recovery for common failures and allow manual interventions for complex scenarios.
- **Data Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Recover data within 1 hour of failure.
- **Data Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Bring systems online within 4 hours.

### 5.4. **Application Recovery**
- **Application Monitoring**: Continuously monitor application performance and health.
- **Snapshot Rollback**: Use infrastructure snapshots to rollback to stable states in case of application corruption.
- **Version Control Rollback**: Revert to the last known stable version in case of code corruption or bugs.
- **Redundant Application Servers**: Implement redundant application instances for failover and load balancing.

### 5.5. **Network & Infrastructure Recovery**
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Ensure secure and private network configurations across multiple cloud environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Deploy environments from version-controlled infrastructure templates to ensure reproducibility.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan Testing**: Regularly test the recovery procedures and validate the robustness of infrastructure.

### 5.6. **Communication & Notifications**
- **Internal Communication**: Regularly update teams on recovery status and post-incident updates via internal communication channels (Slack, email).
- **External Communication**: Establish protocols for communicating service interruptions to customers and stakeholders.
- **Automated Alerts**: Set up monitoring tools to trigger automated alerts for system failures, breaches, and anomalies.

---

## 6. Incident Management
- **Incident Reporting**: Use standardized forms and tools to log incidents.
- **Incident Categorization**: Classify incidents into levels (critical, major, minor) based on impact and urgency.
- **Incident Escalation**: Define escalation paths for resolving incidents in a timely manner.
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Conduct root cause analysis post-incident and document learnings for continuous improvement.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Alerts
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and New Relic to monitor application, infrastructure, and system health in real-time.
- **Alert Configuration**: Set up alerts for CPU/memory usage, database connections, service downtime, and abnormal activity patterns.
- **Log Analysis**: Implement automated log analysis and anomaly detection to proactively address potential issues.

---

## 8. Training & Awareness
- **Regular Training**: Conduct periodic disaster recovery drills and tabletop exercises.
- **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Ensure that all teams are trained on recovery procedures and collaborate effectively during incidents.
- **Documentation Access**: Provide accessible documentation for recovery steps, process workflows, and known recovery points.

---

## 9. Recovery Testing & Validation
- **DRP Testing**: Regularly test recovery procedures to validate that backups are restorable and failover mechanisms work as intended.
- **Recovery Point Testing**: Ensure the recovery point objective (RPO) can be met during simulated disaster scenarios.
- **Recovery Time Testing**: Verify the system can meet recovery time objectives (RTO) in varying conditions.

---

## 10. Post-Recovery Analysis
- **Incident Review**: Conduct detailed post-mortem reviews after recovery to identify weaknesses and process improvements.
- **Documentation Updates**: Update recovery plans and operational documentation based on lessons learned from recovery exercises.
- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop to continuously improve disaster recovery strategies.

---

## 11. Continuous Improvement
- **Periodically Review**: Regularly review the disaster recovery plan to ensure it reflects current technologies, business needs, and operational workflows.
- **Vendor Management**: Periodically review third-party service providers and ensure they have disaster recovery and business continuity plans aligned with the companyâ€™s needs.

---

### 12. Legal & Compliance Considerations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure disaster recovery strategies align with legal and industry compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Maintain compliance with data privacy laws by storing backups in compliant regions.

---

### 13. Emergency Contacts
- **IT Support**: IT emergency response team contact information.
- **Security Team**: Security incident response team contact details.
- **Third-party Vendors**: Contact information for third-party cloud providers and service partners.
