RLG AI-Powered Named Entity Extractor with Reputation & Risk Scoring
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Extracts, analyzes, and scores named entities (people, organizations, locations, brands) for risk and reputation monitoring.

✔ AI-powered Named Entity Recognition (NER) for business intelligence.
✔ Geopolitical & market risk analysis using entity tracking.
✔ Real-time entity reputation scoring based on media sentiment.
✔ Contextual entity relationship mapping (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How).
✔ Multi-language support with automatic translation.
✔ Real-time data scraping from social media, news, blogs, and financial reports.
✔ API-ready deployment for seamless integration with RLG Data & RLG Fans.

Competitive Edge:
🔹 **Tracks entity mentions across platforms and detects geopolitical/economic risks.**  
🔹 **Enhances brand reputation monitoring by analyzing sentiment trends over time.**  
🔹 **Uses AI-powered NLP to extract contextual entity relationships for deeper insights.**
