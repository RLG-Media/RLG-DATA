monetization_opportunities.py

This module defines the MonetizationOpportunities class for identifying, tracking, and optimizing
monetization opportunities across platforms (e.g., for both RLG Data and RLG Fans).

Key Features:
  - Calculates engagement rate from user activity.
  - Estimates potential earnings using a customizable formula.
  - Suggests content strategy based on engagement metrics.
  - Optimizes opportunities by sorting based on potential earnings.
  - Supports retrieval of top N opportunities per platform.
  - Logs opportunities to a file (with daily log naming) for further analysis.
  - (Optional) If location data is provided in user activity, it can be included in the analysis.
  
Additional Recommendations:
  1. For location-specific analysis, extend user activity data to include location details (e.g., country, city, town)
     and use that information to adjust thresholds or strategy suggestions.
  2. Adjust the engagement threshold (currently set at 0.05) dynamically based on platform and location.
  3. Enhance the potential earnings formula with more sophisticated business logic if needed.
  4. Integrate with a database or analytics system for persistent logging and trend analysis over time.
  5. Consider asynchronous processing (or task queues) if analyzing a high volume of data.

Usage Example:
  See the "__main__" section at the end for a demonstration with mocked platform and user data.
