## 1. Authentication
Authentication is required for all API endpoints. RLG Data and RLG Fans use **OAuth 2.0** for secure access. Below are the steps to authenticate and obtain an access token:

### OAuth 2.0 Flow:
1. **Client sends request** to the authorization server.
2. **Authorization code** is returned, and the client exchanges it for an access token.
3. The **access token** is used to authenticate subsequent API requests.

### Example of Authentication Request:
```http
POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Host: api.rlgmedia.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=authorization_code
&code=[AUTHORIZATION_CODE]
