# Security Best Practices for RLG Data & RLG Fans

## Overview
Security is a top priority for RLG Data & RLG Fans. This document outlines best practices to protect user data, ensure compliance, and safeguard our infrastructure. These security measures are designed to protect against data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyber threats while maintaining compliance with industry standards.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all admin accounts and sensitive user actions.
- **JWT & OAuth 2.0:** Implement secure token-based authentication to manage user sessions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Limit access to sensitive data based on user roles.
- **Session Expiry:** Implement automatic session expiration and token revocation mechanisms.

## 2. Data Encryption & Storage
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Encrypt all sensitive data both in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
- **Hashed Passwords:** Store passwords using PBKDF2 or bcrypt with a strong salt.
- **Secure API Keys:** Never store API keys in the codebase; use environment variables instead.
- **Regular Key Rotation:** Update encryption keys periodically to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## 3. Secure API & Data Handling
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Prevent abuse by limiting API requests.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Protect against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.
- **API Gateway Security:** Implement an API gateway with strict validation, logging, and monitoring.
- **Minimal Data Exposure:** Follow the principle of least privilege when sharing data.

## 4. Compliance & Legal Considerations
- **GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA Compliance:** Ensure all data collection, storage, and processing meet legal requirements.
- **User Data Requests:** Allow users to request, modify, or delete their data.
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain detailed audit logs of user actions and system events for accountability.

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment Security
- **Firewalls & Intrusion Detection:** Use cloud-based WAF (Web Application Firewall) and IDS/IPS systems.
- **DDoS Protection:** Implement protection via cloud providers (e.g., AWS Shield, Cloudflare).
- **Automated Backups:** Perform regular encrypted backups and store them securely offsite.
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Implement continuous verification for all access requests.

## 6. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- **Code Reviews:** Enforce peer-reviewed code commits and static analysis checks.
- **Dependency Security:** Use automated tools like Dependabot or Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Secure DevOps (DevSecOps):** Integrate security into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.

## 7. User & Employee Security Awareness
- **Security Training:** Conduct regular security awareness programs for employees.
- **Phishing Prevention:** Use email filtering and awareness training to detect phishing attempts.
- **Incident Response Plan:** Maintain a documented response plan for security incidents.

## 8. Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response
- **SIEM Solutions:** Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time threat monitoring.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Use AI-powered behavioral analytics to detect suspicious activity.
- **Bug Bounty Program:** Encourage ethical hackers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments regularly.

## 9. Enhancements & Future Security Measures
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption:** Exploring ZKP for enhanced privacy and security.
- **AI-Based Threat Detection:** Implement AI-driven security monitoring for proactive threat detection.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Future-proofing authentication mechanisms with blockchain-based identity verification.
