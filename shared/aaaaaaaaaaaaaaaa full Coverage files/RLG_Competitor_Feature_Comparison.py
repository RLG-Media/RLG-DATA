RLG_Competitor_Feature_Comparison.xlsx Generator
-------------------------------------------------

This script generates a comprehensive competitor feature comparison Excel file for
RLG Data and RLG Fans. It is designed to be:
  - Robust, updated, and refined
  - Fully automated and data-driven
  - Scalable and user-friendly with region, country, city, and town accuracy
  - Informative regarding our scraping and compliance tools, all services, and the RLG Super Tool

The generated Excel workbook includes two sheets:
  1. Competitor Comparison:
     - Contains a detailed table comparing our tool against competitors such as Brandwatch,
       Brand24, Mention, Sprout Social, BuzzSumo, Keyhole, Hootsuite, Meltwater, Digimind,
       Brandmentions, Google Alerts, and our own RLG Data and RLG Fans.
  2. Tool Details & Recommendations:
     - Provides in-depth information about our scraping tools, compliance engine, the RLG Super Tool,
       our overall value proposition, and additional recommendations for future enhancements.

All sections are humanized and personalized to reflect the competitive value and strengths
of our platform.

Note: Replace any dummy data with live data or dynamically retrieved information as required.
