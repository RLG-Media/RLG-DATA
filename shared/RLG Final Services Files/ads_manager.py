ads_manager.py

This module defines the AdsManager class, which interfaces with an external ad platform API
to manage advertising campaigns. It supports operations such as authentication, campaign creation,
updates, deletion, performance tracking, budget optimization, and ad spend summary reporting.

The class is designed to be robust, scalable, and flexible, making it suitable for use across
both RLG Data and RLG Fans. Additional recommendations include integration with real-time monitoring,
A/B testing, multi-platform ad management, and advanced reporting tools.
