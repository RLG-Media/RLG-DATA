# Additional recommendations:
# - If you plan to use asynchronous processing or task queues for heavy workloads, consider adding Celery:
#   celery==5.2.7
#
# - For advanced visualization on the client side, you might integrate Plotly:
#   plotly==5.13.0
#
# - If you need to perform advanced NLP tasks beyond basic tokenization, lemmatization, and sentiment analysis,
#   consider installing additional spaCy models and libraries:
#   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
#
# - Ensure that your environment uses HTTPS for secure communication and that any sensitive configuration
#   (e.g., API keys, database credentials) is provided via environment variables.
