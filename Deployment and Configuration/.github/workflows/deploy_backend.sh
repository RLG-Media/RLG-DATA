1. Complete Project Documentation
Prepare a detailed documentation repository with the following:

Technical Overview
Project purpose and architecture overview.
List of all major features and how they are structured.
Technology stack (backend, frontend, database, libraries, services, etc.).
Setup Instructions
Step-by-step guide to set up the development environment locally, including:
Virtual environment setup.
Installing dependencies (Python, Node.js, database, Redis, etc.).
Running the development server for both backend and frontend.
Deployment Process
Detailed instructions for:
Deploying the backend (e.g., Docker, cloud provider, or traditional server).
Deploying the frontend (e.g., static hosting or integration with a CDN).
Setting up and configuring environment variables on the production server.
Include CI/CD setup if applicable.
API Documentation
Use Swagger, Postman, or Redoc to document all APIs.
Include:
Endpoints with methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Request payloads and response examples.
Authentication flow (e.g., JWT tokens, API keys).
Key Diagrams
Architecture diagram (frontend-backend interaction, database schema, etc.).
Data flow for critical features (e.g., analytics pipeline, real-time data updates).
2. Access and Credentials
Hosting and Deployment Platforms
Provide access to all platforms where the tool is or will be deployed:

Cloud Providers: AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
Web Hosting Services: Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting platform.
Database Hosting: PostgreSQL server credentials.
Redis Hosting: Redis server credentials.
Third-Party APIs
Provide all API keys, credentials, and necessary configurations for:
Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, YouTube).
Analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Chart.js).
Streaming services (if applicable).
Email and Notifications
Set up and share credentials for email services (e.g., SMTP configuration, Mailgun).
Notification services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.
Version Control
Ensure the engineer has:
Access to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Clear branching strategy (main, develop, feature branches).
3. Testing and Debugging Resources
Test Suites
Provide unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests already written for the tool.
Mention tools used (e.g., Pytest, Jest, Cypress).
Error Logs
Share access to error tracking tools (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar).
Set up logging configurations for both development and production environments.
Monitoring Tools
Provide access to application performance monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog).
Set up basic alerts for server downtime, API errors, etc.
4. Scalability and Maintenance Notes
Scalability Plan
Guidance on scaling the backend (e.g., horizontal scaling, load balancing).
Frontend optimizations for high traffic (e.g., lazy loading, code splitting).
Database optimization (e.g., indexing, sharding if needed).
Maintenance Best Practices
Routine database backup procedures.
Log rotation and archival policies.
Guidance for updating dependencies to avoid security vulnerabilities.
5. Marketing and Launch Integration
Since youâ€™ll focus on marketing, coordinate these with the full-stack engineer to align technical deployment with launch goals:

SEO Optimization
Ensure meta tags, schema.org markup, and social media previews are implemented.
Add any analytics and tracking codes (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel).
Scalability for Launch
Load testing to ensure the system can handle expected traffic surges.
6. Communication and Handoff Details
Team Contact Information
Provide a primary point of contact for technical questions.
Include backup contacts if the engineer needs clarification on non-technical aspects (e.g., marketing goals).
Handoff Meeting
Schedule a walkthrough meeting to review all documentation and answer questions.
Record this session if possible for future reference.
Timeline and Milestones
Set clear milestones for deployment, testing, and launch.
Agree on a deadline for resolving any outstanding issues.
7. Tools and Resources for the Engineer
Recommended Tools
Code Editors: VS Code with extensions (e.g., Python, Prettier).
Debugging Tools: Browser dev tools, Postman.
Database Management: DBeaver, pgAdmin for PostgreSQL.
Task Management: Trello, Asana, or Jira for tracking progress.
Resource Links
Links to relevant SDKs, API documentation, and libraries.
Tutorials or guides for specific technologies used in your stack.
