Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our Pledge

We as contributors, maintainers, and community members pledge to create an inclusive, welcoming, and respectful environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to fostering an open, safe, and collaborative environment where harassment, discrimination, and exclusionary behaviors are not tolerated.

Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

Demonstrating respect and empathy toward all individuals.
Being considerate of differing opinions, perspectives, and experiences.
Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
Focusing on what is best for the community.
Showing kindness and encouragement, especially to new contributors.
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
Public or private harassment, including deliberate intimidation or stalking.
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, as well as to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channel used by the community. It also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at support@rlgmedia.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be provided separately.
